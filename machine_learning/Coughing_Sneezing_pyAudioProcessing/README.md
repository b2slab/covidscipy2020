## News
 * [2020-03-20] pip package has been updated [version 0.3.0](https://pypi.org/manage/project/pyAudioAnalysis/release/0.3.0/)
 * pyAudioAnalysis master [2019-11-19] contains major refactoring changes mainly in feature extraction. Please report possible issues that have not been fixed, or inconsistencies in the documentation.  
 * Check the tutorial for the course ["Multimodal Information Processing & Analysis", MSc in Data Science in NCSR-D](https://github.com/tyiannak/multimodalAnalysis)
 * Check out [paura](https://github.com/tyiannak/paura) a python script for realtime recording and analysis of audio data
 * Check [pyVisualizeMp3Tags](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyVisualizeMp3Tags) a Python script to visualize mp3 tags and lyrics
 * pyAudioAnalysis [2018-08-12] now ported to Python 3

## General
pyAudioAnalysis is a Python library covering a wide range of audio analysis tasks. Through pyAudioAnalysis you can:
 * Extract audio *features* and representations (e.g. mfccs, spectrogram, chromagram)
 * *Classify* unknown sounds
 * *Train*, parameter tune and *evaluate* classifiers of audio segments
 * *Detect* audio events and exclude silence periods from long recordings
 * Perform *supervised segmentation* (joint segmentation - classification)
 * Perform *unsupervised segmentation* (e.g. speaker diarization)
 * Extract audio *thumbnails*
 * Train and use *audio regression* models (example application: emotion recognition)
 * Apply dimensionality reduction to *visualize* audio data and content similarities

## Installation
 * Clone the source of this library:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis.git
```
 * Install dependencies:
 ```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
 * Install using pip:
 ```
pip install -e .
```
(also works with pip3 now)

## An audio classification example
> More examples and detailed tutorials can be found [at the wiki](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki)

pyAudioAnalysis provides easy-to-call wrappers to execute audio analysis tasks. Eg, this code first trains an audio segment classifier, given a set of WAV files stored in folders (each folder representing a different class) and then the trained classifier is used to classify an unknown audio WAV file

```
from pyAudioAnalysis import audioTrainTest as aT
aT.extract_features_and_train(["classifierData/music","classifierData/speech"], 1.0, 1.0, aT.shortTermWindow, aT.shortTermStep, "svm", "svmSMtemp", False)
aT.file_classification("data/doremi.wav", "svmSMtemp","svm")
Result:
(0.0, array([ 0.90156761,  0.09843239]), ['music', 'speech'])
```

In addition, command-line support is provided for all functionalities. E.g. the following command extracts the spectrogram of an audio signal stored in a WAV file: `python audioAnalysis.py fileSpectrogram -i data/doremi.wav`
